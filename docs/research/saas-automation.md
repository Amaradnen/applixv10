## Gaps & Opportunities

### What Competitors Miss:

3. **Hidden Costs:** Unclear pricing until you use it
4. **No ROI Calculator:** Hard to justify cost savings
5. **Poor Agent Discovery:** Hard to find the right automation
6. **Limited Industry Focus:** Generic, not tailored

### APPLIX Better-Than Strategy:

#### 1. **Industry-Specific Agents (Unique)**
Instead of generic "Slack to Google Sheets," create:

- **HR Agent:** Onboarding automation + document management
- **Finance Agent:** Invoice processing + expense tracking

#### 2. **Visual Workflow Previews**
- Animated flowcharts showing how agent works
- Real example data flowing through
- Before/after comparisons
- Video tutorials per agent

#### 3. **ROI Calculator (Killer Feature)**
```
Input:
- Current manual time spent
- Hourly rate of employees
- Frequency of task

Output:
- Hours saved per month
- Cost savings per year
- Payback period
```

#### 4. **One-Click Setup Templates**
- Pre-configured workflows
- Industry-specific templates
- Connect your apps in 3 steps
- Guided onboarding wizard

#### 5. **Integration Showcase**
- Logo badges for each integration
- "Works with: Slack, HubSpot, Gmail..."
- Visual connection diagram
- API documentation links

#### 6. **Agent Marketplace**
- Browse by industry (Sales, Marketing, HR, etc.)
- Browse by integration (Slack, Gmail, HubSpot)
- Browse by use case (Lead Gen, Support, Reporting)
