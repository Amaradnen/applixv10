## Gaps & Opportunities

### What Competitors Miss:
1. **No Tiered Memberships:** Hard to create VIP/Pro/Free tiers within one community
2. **Limited Content Gating:** Basic "member-only" but not granular
3. **Poor Resource Organization:** Content is in discussions, hard to find
4. **No Bundle Offers:** Can't combine membership + products
5. **Weak Analytics:** Who's active? Who's churning? Not clear
6. **Generic Branding:** Looks like a community platform, not your brand

### APPLIX Hub Better-Than Strategy:

```

#### 3. **Gated Content Strategy**
